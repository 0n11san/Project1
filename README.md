who's responsible for Merges : TBD;

Luis --- validation (making sure code works; semicolons missing; etc);

GitHub Issue Enforcer : 
(makes sure eveyrone is creating issues for things they're working on)

Project Board Enforcer :
(makes sure issues are being moved)

Branch Master Enforcer: 

## Notes
-(move every issue into one of these "columns"):
to do
in progress
code review
done (merged)


## Requirements

ADDITIONAL
- Utilize firebase (persistent data storage) consider this basically a requirement;
users can leave reviews 1-5 stars;
- Mobile responsiveness
-code MUST be shared via Github & Pull requests
-use Github project boards
-at beginning of each class, each group has a standup meeting (think Agile development & sprints):
    -what did u do yesterday?; what about today?; do you have any blockers?
